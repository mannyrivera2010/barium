### Intro
Hello My name is Manny, I am a software engineer. I am very interested in distributed computing     

### Motivation
This project was done for Towson University Cosc 880 - Graduate Project     

Quote from Towson University Computer Science Website "A graduate project (COSC880) serves the purpose of providing applied skills to the student. That means, graduate project should be focused on implementation and learning skills for the student. The graduate project can also be based on survey of current topics in a given field of study and write a paper for publication. Graduate faculty plays a role of training the student to write a proposal, analyze a problem, collect requirements for a problem, design, implement, test, and demonstrate a chosen problem."
